# Resolution
In this project I used all the technologies suggested.
### Front-end [frontend](frontend)
In the front-end I'm using Vue.js 3 composition API (instead of the options API).
Technologies I am using:
- Quasar v2.0.0-beta-19
- Vuex
- Axios
- Sass

### Backend [backend](backend)
I'm using Spring Boot with Gradle.
Technologies I am using:
- Spring Boot v.2.5.0
- LiquiBase
- PostgreSQL

### Docker
I also added a [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) in order to deploy the entire app for testing purposes:

Just run the following command on the root of this project:
```docker-compose up --build```

### Considerations
Due the time given to resolve the test:
- I did not add security features (Authorization & Authentication) assuming that these mechanisms already exist in a real project.
- For easy testing I disable the basic authentication.
